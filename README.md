Hackathon Problem 1: Digital Manufacturing – Obfuscating the design with security features  
Research Focus :  • Digital manufacturing • Cybersecurity  • Cyber-physical systems  • Reverse engineering  • File manipulation  • CAD/STL/G-code  • Software and hardware
Our team “Tesseract” secured the 2nd position in the 2021 ASME-CIE Hackathon (Problem #1) organised by ASME (The American Society of Mechanical Engineers) held on 14-15th August 2021. The topic of the hackathon was to explore the power of Data and Cybersecurity for Mechanical Engineering. Our Team chose Problem #1 which was provided by New York University (NYU)
We used many approaches to figure out the sides of the dice. At last we used Brute Force Hacking to solve the bonus problem and this helped us to solve the first part of the challenge. The judges found our approach unique and our team won the 2nd Prize.
